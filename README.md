# Emihle Thole - Digital Portfolio


Welcome to my **Work Readiness Program**. This portfolio showcases my journey, reflections, and growth throughout my academic and personal development as an ICT student at CPUT.

I’m a final-year Diploma in ICT student majoring in Application Development at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, and I’ve also completed a Higher Certificate in ICT. My passion lies in creating efficient, user-friendly software solutions that solve real-world problems.

I have hands-on experience with Java, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve worked on several academic and personal projects, including mobile app designs using Figma, desktop applications with Java Swing, and database-driven systems. I’m also comfortable using tools like GitHub and applying Agile principles in team environments.
